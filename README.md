### Overview and Problem Statement
The focus for this project is to use data from the Kings County House Sales dataset to create a regression model that projects the sale price of properties in the area.

The scope of this project includes data cleaning, initial exploratory analysis, model improvement with additional or transformed variables, final recommendation, and overall evaluation.

By the end of this project, the goal is to derive a model that identifies the relevant features which account for price variations in homes within the region. The model should act as a guide for property buyers and sellers in the area so they can pinpoint attributes of a home that they should emphasize when negotiating prices.
